## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
- Physical device for testing (recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd whatsapp-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run on device/simulator**
   - iOS: Press `i` in the terminal or scan QR code with Camera app
   - Android: Press `a` in the terminal or scan QR code with Expo Go app

## 📲 Testing on Mobile Devices

### Using Expo Go (Recommended for Development)
1. **Download Expo Go**
   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. **Connect to Development Server**
   - Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal
   - Or enter the URL manually in Expo Go

3. **Test All Features**
   - Authentication with demo credentials
   - Real-time messaging
   - Camera and media sharing
   - Voice recording
   - Push notifications

## 🔥 Firebase Setup (Optional for Real Backend)

The app is designed to work with Firebase. To connect to a real backend:

1. **Create a Firebase project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage

2. **Install Firebase SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   ```typescript
   // firebase.config.ts
   import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
   import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
   import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
   import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';

   const firebaseConfig = {
     // Your Firebase config
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const auth = getAuth(app);
   export const firestore = getFirestore(app);
   export const storage = getStorage(app);
   ```

4. **Replace Mock Service**
   Update `services/FirebaseService.ts` with real Firebase calls

## 🔔 Push Notifications Setup

1. **Get Expo Push Token**
   ```bash
   expo install expo-notifications
   ```

2. **Configure Notifications**
   - The app automatically requests notification permissions
   - Push tokens are generated for each device
   - Notifications work in development and production

3. **Test Notifications**
   - Send test notifications through Expo's push service
   - Notifications appear when app is backgrounded
   - Tap notifications to navigate to specific chats
